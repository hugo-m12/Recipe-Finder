This Project Was developed for the Back-End Final Project for The Flag Fullstack Web Devlopment Course, the main goal of this project was to develop a full-stack web application for a Recipe Finder Web App, where users can search for and view recipes based on ingredients they have. Users can browse a catalog of recipes, get recommendations for similar recipes, like their favorite recipes, and view Chef's Picks of the Week.
The primary focus is on backend development, with a simple, user-friendly frontend.
