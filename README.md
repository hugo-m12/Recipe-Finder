# Recipe-Finder

The goal of this project was to develop a full-stack web application for a Recipe Finder Web App, where users can search for and view recipes based on ingredients they have. Users can browse a catalog of recipes, get recommendations for similar recipes, like their favorite recipes, and view Chef's Picks of the Week.
The primary focus is on backend development, with a simple, user-friendly frontend.

This Project Was made in node.js for the BE Api + React.js for the FE with mongo DB as a Database.
